# LITTLE LEMON BOOKING WEBSITE

# Project Description
This project was produced as part of Meta's Front-End Development course on Coursera. The Front-End Development Track culminated in the creation of this website.
On this website, a booking application implementation on the Little Lemon Website was demonstrated. This was made using React Components to demonstrate how React was used to build the website. Additionally, this includes utilzing API calls.
Please be aware that the Reserve a Table feature is the only functional aspect of this website that is operational.
